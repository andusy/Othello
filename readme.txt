Othello board game created grade 11 final project.

Rules:
Game Set-up
-The dimension of the game board is 8X8.
-Initially, the game will be set-up with 2 black disks and 2 white disks at the centre of the board.  They are arranged with black forming a North-East to South-West direction and white forming the North-West to South-East direction.  This is illustrated in Figure 1 below.

Making Moves 
-Black always moves first
-A move is made by placing a disk of the player’s colour on the board in a space that is adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally to an existing disk.   In Figure 2 below, ? marks all the valid spaces for the next move.
-A move may result in “outflanking” one or more opponent’s disks.  A disk or row of disks is outflanked when it is surrounded at the ends by disks of the opposite colour.  The opponent’s disk(s) which is / are outflanked in that move will then be flipped over to the player’s colour.  In Figure 3 below, by placing a black disk at D7, white disks at D4, D5 and D6 will be outflanked.  Those white disks will be flipped to black, as illustrated in Figure 4
-A player may not skip over his own colour disk to outflank an opponent’s disk.  In Figure 7, placing a black disk at G1 only outflanks the white disk at G2, and no others.
-Disks may only be outflanked as a direct result of a move and must fall in the direct line of the disk placed down.  In Figure 8, placing a black disk at B1 outflanks white disks at C1 and D1.  After the two white disks are flipped to black, white disks at D2 and D3 remains white, as illustrated in Figure 9.
-The game ends when there is no more empty space left on the board.  The player with the majority of his disks on the board is the winner.
